# PyRogueLikeThing
This is my rogue clone, which takes inspiration from lots of things. I am using this to learn to python better.

I'll be publishing updates via github, if you want to code along with me, or find out that I have a horrible horrible bug that will kill your windows install and fix it before fuckin space aliens destroy our society.


remote_dev_test.py is a utility that outputs the map to mapdebug.txt, allowing for troubleshooting the map generation system

you could theoretically use it to make an actual ascii version?
