TIME FOR GIRAFFICS:

I whipped up a very basic set of sprites that we can use for the map right now: 

Nothing fancy, but just something to draw to the screen.

At first, I would just generate a map, then show what would fit in the window size, but this isn't really usable for actual gameplay, since you can go outside of the window space easily. 

Since I haven't figured out exactly how I want to manage the player sprite yet, I just made generic numbers that can be changed with the arrow keys to make the screen move, but now I'm hitting a wall: once the camera is no longer being locked to the corner, it seems to go backwards before trying to reference an out of bounds area and crashing the game. 

I spent a while fighting with the rendering code to make it show the right spot on the screen, since 


I'm shifting focus to thinking about map generation, since truly random rooms does make placing hallways a pain in the ass, and I can think of a few different options for how to handle it:
- keep random rooms, and write something which carves out the path between each room as it is placed
- start at a known point and snake to all the known rooms
- dump our current generation system, and use fixed room types, with random positions.
